# Acceptance Criteria for `cfg-iif` (EARS Format)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the `cfg-iif` crate using the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

## General
- **AC1:** The system shall provide a macro named `cfg_iif!`.
- **AC2:** The system shall be compatible with `no_std` environments.
- **AC3:** The system shall compile successfully with Rustc version 1.56.1 and later.

## Macro Behavior
- **AC4:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is invoked, the system shall perform conditional compilation based on the provided `#[cfg]` attribute or shorthand.

### Standard Syntax
- **AC5:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is called with the `#[cfg(condition)] { true_case } else { false_case }` syntax, the system shall expand to the `true_case` code if the `condition` is met, otherwise it shall expand to the `false_case` code.
- **AC6:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is called with the `#[cfg(condition)] { true_case }` syntax, the system shall expand to the `true_case` code if the `condition` is met, otherwise it shall expand to nothing.

### Shorthand Syntax
- **AC7:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is called with the `condition { true_case } else { false_case }` syntax, the system shall expand to the `true_case` code if the `condition` is met, otherwise it shall expand to the `false_case` code.
- **AC8:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is called with the `condition { true_case }` syntax, the system shall expand to the `true_case` code if the `condition` is met, otherwise it shall expand to nothing.

## Usage Contexts
- **AC9:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is used as an expression (e.g., in a `let` binding), the system shall return the value from the executed code block.
- **AC10:** When the `cfg_iif!` macro is used as a statement, the system shall execute the code within the appropriate block.

## Verification
- **AC11:** The system shall include a test suite that successfully verifies AC5, AC6, AC7, AC8, AC9, and AC10 for various conditions like `target_family` and `feature` flags.
